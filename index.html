            <h3>What I am & where I want to be</h3>
            <p>
                As a person, I value honesty, optimism and faithfulness in myself and others. During my first year of Bachelor 
                of Commerce course, I realised that I enjoy statistical analysis, which led me to a career in data science. 
                My vision is formed around what I enjoy. I want to secure a full-time role as a data scientist, where I can 
                use data to find insights that help drive decision making. To work towards this vision, I chose Business 
                analytics and Econometrics as my majors to gain most of the hard skills required for a data scientist. <br>
                <br>
                The following is an analysis of Tomlinson's (2017) graduate capital model, highlighting aspects that I am very 
                strong at and those that still have a lot of potential for improvement. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Human Capital</b> <br>
                I have acquired the majority of the technical skills necessary to work as a professional data scientist 
                throughout my time studying at Monash University. I can foreground the links between the skills that I have 
                acquired and the requirements of the jobs in the market. I do need to work on developing a few skills, though. 
                Python programming is the most crucial ability I need to master because, according to Loon (2022), it is the 
                programming language most frequently demanded for a data science position. I have a solid background in R but 
                very little experience with Python because R was the primary programming language used when I was in school. <br>
                
                <br>
                <b>Social Capital</b> <br>
                I have already established strong connections with my family and friends from high school before joining Monash. 
                I have grown my network by forming connections with certain people who share similar interests during my time 
                at Monash. But because of the pandemic, it was challenging to develop relationships, and as a result, my network 
                did not grow as much as it should have. I think I still need to concentrate on expanding my network, especially 
                with people in my field. Not so long ago, I created a LinkedIn profile to help me grow my network and keep 
                tabs on any emerging career opportunities. <br>

                Moreover, working at Amazon warehouse for over a year has helped me develop good teamwork and communication 
                skills, which will be beneficial for my career. I've developed close bonds with both my manager and my 
                co-workers. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Cultural Capital</b> <br>
                I have made a diverse number of friends and colleagues and have shown my broad understanding by being part of 
                several diverse teams. My appreciation and comprehension of many cultures have grown as a result of this 
                exposure. My understanding of cultures had grown while I was working at Amazon, which made it simple for me 
                to fit in at work. I should keep an open mind going forward and be willing to expand my comprehension and 
                adaptability in order to continue to develop. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Identity Capital</b> <br>
                I have made some developments in my identity capital. By being introspective, I have identified my strengths 
                and areas that need improvement. Over many years, I wondered why I feared of being judged, lacked confidence 
                in giving my opinions, and feared of trying. Just recently, I learned that all this is because I have low 
                self-esteem. Going forward, I need to boost my self-esteem and try to reform any other weaknesses I have 
                in order to develop my 'employable self'. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Psychological Capital</b> <br>
                The pandemic has allowed me to be more resilient while coping with change in relation to moving to online 
                studies. I have been proactive in advancing my career through online education rather than waiting to continue
                my studies till everything went back to normal, as some people have done. I learned to tolerate uncertainty 
                and withstand setback. Moreover, working full-time at Amazon and studying full-time while maintaining my grades 
                at High Distinction, I demonstrated that I could perform well under pressure. <br>
