            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Hi, welcome to my webpage. My name is Dilan Vekaria and I am currently in my last semester of a degree 
                in Commerce majoring in Business Analytics and Econometrics. <br>
                <br>

                This webpage contains my Graduate Development Strategy comprising of a reflection of my current skills using 
                Tomlinson's (2017) Graduate Capital Model, reflection on what I have learned in this unit (BEX3500) and what 
                additional skills I still need to develop to achieve my professional goal.

            </p>

            <h3>What I am & where I want to be</h3>
            <p>
                As a person, I value honesty, optimism and faithfulness in myself and others. During my first year of Bachelor 
                of Commerce course, I realised that I enjoy statistical analysis, which led me to a career in data science. 
                My vision is formed around what I enjoy. I want to secure a full-time role as a data scientist, where I can 
                use data to find insights that help drive decision making. To work towards this vision, I chose Business 
                analytics and Econometrics as my majors to gain most of the hard skills required for a data scientist. <br>
                <br>
                The following is an analysis of Tomlinson's (2017) graduate capital model, highlighting aspects that I am very 
                strong at and those that still have a lot of potential for improvement. <br>
                <br>
                <b class="sub">Human Capital</b> <br>
                I have acquired the majority of the technical skills necessary to work as a professional data scientist 
                throughout my time studying at Monash University. I can foreground the links between the skills that I have 
                acquired and the requirements of the jobs in the market. I do need to work on developing a few skills, though. 
                Python programming is the most crucial ability I need to master because, according to Loon (2022), it is the 
                programming language most frequently demanded for a data science position. I have a solid background in R but 
                very little experience with Python because R was the primary programming language used when I was in school. <br>
                
                <br>
                <b class="sub">Social Capital</b> <br>
                I have already established strong connections with my family and friends from high school before joining Monash. 
                I have grown my network by forming connections with certain people who share similar interests during my time 
                at Monash. But because of the pandemic, it was challenging to develop relationships, and as a result, my network 
                did not grow as much as it should have. I think I still need to concentrate on expanding my network, especially 
                with people in my field. Not so long ago, I created a LinkedIn profile to help me grow my network and keep 
                tabs on any emerging career opportunities. <br>

                Moreover, working at Amazon warehouse for over a year has helped me develop good teamwork and communication 
                skills, which will be beneficial for my career. I've developed close bonds with both my manager and my 
                co-workers. <br>
                <br>
                <b class="sub">Cultural Capital</b> <br>
                I have made a diverse number of friends and colleagues and have shown my broad understanding by being part of 
                several diverse teams. My appreciation and comprehension of many cultures have grown as a result of this 
                exposure. My understanding of cultures had grown while I was working at Amazon, which made it simple for me 
                to fit in at work. I should keep an open mind going forward and be willing to expand my comprehension and 
                adaptability in order to continue to develop. <br>
                <br>
                <b class="sub">Identity Capital</b> <br>
                I have made some developments in my identity capital. By being introspective, I have identified my strengths 
                and areas that need improvement. Over many years, I wondered why I feared of being judged, lacked confidence 
                in giving my opinions, and feared of trying. Just recently, I learned that all this is because I have low 
                self-esteem. Going forward, I need to boost my self-esteem and try to reform any other weaknesses I have 
                in order to develop my 'employable self'. <br>
                <br>
                <b class="sub">Psychological Capital</b> <br>
                The pandemic has allowed me to be more resilient while coping with change in relation to moving to online 
                studies. I have been proactive in advancing my career through online education rather than waiting to continue
                my studies till everything went back to normal, as some people have done. I learned to tolerate uncertainty 
                and withstand setback. Moreover, working full-time at Amazon and studying full-time while maintaining my grades 
                at High Distinction, I demonstrated that I could perform well under pressure. <br>

            <h3>What I've learned</h3>
            <p>
                <b class="sub">Creativity</b> <br>
                When it comes to creativity, many people think about art and imagination. However, creativity has a different 
                meaning in a commerce degree. Shch (2020) defines creativity as “a way of thinking that inspires, challenges, 
                and helps people to find innovative solutions and create opportunities out of problems” (para. 2). Both 
                innovation and inspiration come from creativity (Shch, 2020). <br>
                <br>

                In BEX3500, completing the major project required creative skills. Creative skills were required to help 
                understand how construction companies, like Laing O’Rourke, have a negative impact on life below water. 
                These skills were also required to come up with innovative ways on how the company can reduce its impact 
                on marine life. Moreover, I have demonstrated creativity in BEX3500 by producing websites for the major 
                project and this assessment. <br>
                <br>

                Some of the important attributes of creativity are: <br>
                <b>Curiosity -</b> Always asking “Why?” helps one to get a better understanding in a particular concept, which 
                could lead to innovation of new ideas. To grow as a data scientist, curiosity is important because it would 
                help me to better understand the context of the project I would be working on. Asking questions will help in 
                brainstorming and could also help in building relationships with my colleagues, improving my social capital. <br>
                <br> 

                <b>Risk-taking -</b> Being creative involves the willingness to take risks in relation to trying out new ideas. 
                You do not know if an idea is bad until you test it. Creative people tend to learn from their mistakes and 
                improve upon them in the future. Data scientists experiment with ideas like using new models or creating new 
                features and sometimes these ideas may not help in improving the model outcome. Therefore, taking risks is 
                vital for data scientists. Being a risk-taker will strengthen my psychological capital as I would learn to 
                withstand setbacks. <br>
                <br>

                <b class="sub">Critical thinking</b> <br>
                Critical thinking involves gathering information and analysing it in various ways (evaluate from many angles, 
                consider advantages and disadvantages) to make informed decisions (Oxford College, 2021). BEX3500 has required 
                the use of critical thinking skills several times. Firstly, developing a logical recommendation for the major 
                project required evaluating the pros and cons of several solutions we had and deciding on which solution to 
                recommend. In addition, critical thinking was required to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses regarding 
                Tomlinson's (2017) Graduate Capital Model. Moreover, conducting the informational interview allowed me to 
                critically analyse whether I really want to pursue a career in data science. <br>
                <br>

                Some important attributes of critical thinking are: <br>
                <b>Open-mindedness -</b> Keeping an open mind allows critical thinkers to hear others' points of view and opinions. 
                I conducted the informational interview by keeping an open mind. Listening to the interviewee's view on data 
                science cleared my doubt on this career. In the future, listening to other people's views could also clear 
                some doubts that I could have. As a data scientist I will have to work as a team and will have to listen to 
                others' opinions on the project at task regarding what model to be used or which variables to use. This will 
                help build relationship, developing my social capital. <br>
                <br>

                <b>Introspective -</b> Being introspective enables one to better understand oneself by critically analysing one's own 
                strengths and weaknesses. The informational interview allowed me to be introspective and think about what I 
                need to do to become a professional data scientist. I realised which skills I still need to develop. Being 
                introspective in the future will allow me to understand my weaknesses and find ways of improvement, thus 
                developing my identity capital. <br>
                <br>

                <b class="sub">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</b> <br>
                The SDGs provide some kind of framework that businesses across the world could use for decision-making. As a 
                commerce graduate, learning about the SDGs is important to develop an understanding of the significant global 
                issues, getting inspired to take positive actions. <br>
                <br>

                Before BEX3500, I had never heard of the SDGs. This unit provided me an opportunity to learn about the SDGs 
                and why they are important. I believe I can help advance the sustainability goals and outcomes. As a data 
                scientist I could provide measures on how the business is performing in relation to the SDGs and provide 
                statistics that could help in making decisions regarding the SDGs.

            <h3>What I need to do to get there</h3>
            <p>
                In order to achieve my vision, I would need to develop my graduate capital as outlined by Tomlinson (2017), 
                especially human, social and identity capitals. <br>
                <br>

                <b class="sub">Human Capital</b> <br>
                In terms of my human capital, I plan to complete an honours year in 2023 to develop further knowledge that 
                would be advantageous for my career. My goal is to acquire a first-class honours degree in business analytics 
                in 2023. <br>
                <br>

                Moreover, I need to improve my programming skills in python because it is listed as a required skill in most 
                jobs of data science. My goal is to develop python skills by June 2023. There are several python courses 
                available online. To achieve this goal, I will partake a few of these courses and then participate in some 
                Kaggle competitions to apply my new skills to some data science problems. <br>
                <br>

                In addition, I would also need to develop knowledge in some additional data science tools. According to 
                Data Flair (2022), some of the data science tools widely used in 2022 are SAS, Apache Spark, BigML and MATLAB. 
                It is very difficult to learn all these tools in a short time, so I plan to learn these tools slowly as I 
                progress my career. <br>
                <br>

                Data science is an evolving discipline. There is always new concepts or tools coming in. The growing nature of 
                data science could be a potential setback because it is almost impossible to master data science. The best I 
                can do is keep track of the trends in data science and keep learning as I progress my career. <br>
                <br>

                <b class="sub">Social Capital</b> <br>
                Regarding my social capital, I need to expand my network to include people within the same field. I plan to 
                partake in a graduate program at Deloitte in 2024, ideally in risk advisory. Through this program, I will be 
                able to connect with people who share my interests, growing my network and advancing my career. Moreover, 
                it will provide me an opportunity to get to know what attributes and behaviours are valued by the employers, 
                improving my cultural capital. <br>
                <br>

                A potential setback could be getting rejected for the program due to failing to meet the requirements. To 
                remedy this, I would need to double check whether I have met all the requirements of the program. I could 
                also apply to other graduate programs as a backup. <br>
                <br>

                <b class="sub">Identity Capital</b> <br>
                As I continue to progress into my career, I should perform self-reflection to identify and evaluate my 
                strengths and weaknesses both professionally and personally. I would need to develop strategies to strengthen 
                my weaknesses to help develop my work identity. I would also need to evaluate any strengths and weaknesses 
                in any of the other capitals and take action to improve on them as I progress into my career. One of the ways 
                to help identify my strengths and weaknesses is getting feedback from others because other people might reveal 
                some information that I am not aware of. Moreover, other people could also give some advice on how to 
                strengthen the weaknesses.
